# Monorepo

This is a POC of multiple Rewired Create React Apps using a shared component library all wrapped up in some Yarn Workspaces.


## Based on:

* [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/)
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [Create React App Rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired)


## Currently supporting:

* Config overrides
* Component library
* Shared code
* .editorconfig
* ESlint


## To investigate:

* ENV Config and Featureflags
* Versioning of shared components - if that's required
* Unit tests - jest config
* CSS - styled components
* Typescript
* Theming / partners
* Prettier
* Build tasks
* Accessibility tests

<!--
## Stuff it might be worth adding

It might be worth adding some other stuff to one of the apps so it becomes a better boilerplate for future projects

* Redux
* Sagas
* Reselect
